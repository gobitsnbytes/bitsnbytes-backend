# AGENTS.md - Technical and Product Decisions

**Last Updated**: January 1, 2026 (Teams & Members added)

This file contains all approved technical and product decisions for the Event Management MVP.

## Decision Log

### 1. Calendar Implementation
**Decision**: Hybrid approach (Option C)
- Use calendar library for date/time logic and calculations
- Build custom UI components using shadcn primitives for full theme control
- Ensures consistent design language while reducing complexity

### 2. Multi-Event Support
**Decision**: Multiple events per organizer (Option B)
- Organizers can create and manage multiple events
- Requires event list/switcher in main sidebar
- Each event has its own workspace

### 3. State Management Strategy
**Decision**: Zustand + React Query (Option C)
- Zustand for global UI state (theme, current event, sidebar state)
- React Query for server state, caching, and Supabase interactions
- Provides optimal balance of simplicity and functionality for MVP

### 4. Real-time Calendar Updates
**Decision**: No real-time (Option B)
- Standard polling or manual refresh only
- Simpler implementation for MVP
- Sufficient for single-organizer use case

### 5. Authentication Methods
**Decision**: Email/password only (Option A)
- Supabase Auth email/password flow
- No OAuth providers in MVP
- Simplest to implement and test

### 6. Calendar Entry Form UI
**Decision**: Inline popover at click location (Option C)
- Uses shadcn Popover component
- More natural interaction for calendar clicking
- Appears at/near the clicked time slot or entry

### 7. Timezone Handling
**Decision**: UTC storage, browser display (Option A)
- All times stored in UTC in Supabase
- Display in user's browser timezone automatically
- Standard practice for web calendar apps

### 8. Event Workspace Structure
**Decision**: Workspace as environment container
- Main sidebar contains: event switcher, workspace tools (calendar, settings, etc.)
- Calendar is ONE tool within the workspace
- Workspace can contain other tools in future (not in MVP scope)
- Calendar page has its own internal nested sidebar (sidebar-12 pattern)

### 9. Calendar Entry Deletion
**Decision**: Simple confirm dialog (Option A)
- Standard shadcn AlertDialog
- "Cancel" and "Delete" buttons
- No undo mechanism in MVP

### 10. Default Calendar View on Load
**Decision**: Week containing today, with user preference (Option B + preference)
- Default: Show week containing current date
- Store user's preferred default view in user_settings table
- Preference options: week, month (day view removed)

### 11. Home Page Layout (Updated Dec 31, 2025)
**Decision**: Events listing page without sidebar
- First page shows all events in a card grid layout
- No sidebar on home page - cleaner entry experience
- Sidebar only appears when entering an event workspace
- Header with settings and sign-out on home page
- Users must explicitly select or create an event to enter workspace

### 12. Event Icon System (Added Dec 31, 2025)
**Decision**: Emoji-based event icons
- Default icon: 🎉 (party popper)
- Users can select from 40+ preset emoji options
- Stored in `icon` column on events table
- Displayed in sidebar event switcher and event cards
- More visual and recognizable than generic calendar icon

### 13. Event Date Range (Added Dec 31, 2025)
**Decision**: Optional start and end dates for events
- Events now have optional `start_date` and `end_date` fields
- Displayed on event cards for context
- Database constraint ensures end_date >= start_date
- Format: "MMM d - MMM d, yyyy" or "Starts MMM d, yyyy"

### 14. Email Verification UX (Added Dec 31, 2025)
**Decision**: Show verification prompt instead of failure
- When Supabase requires email verification, show success message
- Clear instructions to check email and verify
- Link to try again if email not received
- Organizer record created after email verification (via auth callback)

### 15. Calendar View Options (Updated Jan 1, 2025)
**Decision**: Week and Month views only
- Day view removed from calendar
- Week view is the primary detailed view
- Month view shows event overview with click-to-week navigation
- Simplifies UI while maintaining essential functionality

### 16. Overlapping Events Layout (Added Jan 1, 2025)
**Decision**: Staggered column-based layout
- Events that overlap are placed in side-by-side columns
- Algorithm assigns each event to the first available column
- Events with same start time are sorted by duration (longer first)
- Visual width calculation: event width = 100% / totalColumns
- Google Calendar-style overlapping visualization

### 17. Calendar Drag Interactions (Added Jan 1, 2025)
**Decision**: Full drag support with visual feedback
- **Drag to move**: Drag events to different times/days with preview
- **Resize**: Top and bottom edge handles to adjust duration
- **Drag to create**: Click and drag on empty space to create new events
- **Month view drag**: Move events between days while preserving time
- 15-minute snap grid for all drag operations
- Visual indicators show drop targets and drag previews

### 18. Calendar Sidebar (Added Jan 1, 2025, Updated Jan 1, 2026)
**Decision**: Google Calendar-style sidebar using shadcn sidebar-12 pattern
- Mini calendar for quick date navigation
- Calendars list with color coding and visibility toggles
- Create new calendars with custom names and colors
- Eye icon to show/hide calendar events
- Fixed width (256px) on left side of calendar view
- **Updated Jan 1, 2026**: Rewritten using shadcn sidebar-12 block pattern
  - Uses shadcn Sidebar component with proper composition
  - Collapsible calendars section with ChevronRight rotation indicator
  - SidebarMenu, SidebarMenuItem, SidebarMenuButton for proper structure
  - DatePicker section uses SidebarGroup and SidebarGroupContent
  - Footer with "New Calendar" button using SidebarFooter
  - Proper sidebar theme integration with bg-sidebar-primary and text-sidebar-primary-foreground
  - Simple color dot indicator (no checkboxes) - visual simplicity
  - Eye/EyeSlash icons on hover for visibility toggling
  - Lock icon for default/protected calendars

### 19. Calendars System (Added Jan 1, 2025)
**Decision**: Multiple calendars per event for organization
- Each event workspace can have multiple calendars
- Calendars have: name, color, visibility toggle
- Calendar events can be assigned to a specific calendar
- Default colors: Blue, Red, Green, Yellow, Purple, Pink, Orange, Teal, Indigo, Gray
- Calendars stored in `calendars` table with event_id foreign key

### 20. Drag-to-Create Coordinate Fix (Added Dec 31, 2025)
**Decision**: Unified coordinate system for all drag operations
- **Issue**: Drag-to-create was inaccurate because `handleCreateStart` used day column rect while `handleMouseMove` and `handleMouseUp` used grid rect
- **Fix**: All handlers now use `gridRef` bounding rect with scroll offset
- **Key change**: Added `gridRef.current.scrollTop` to Y coordinate calculation
- Ensures consistent positioning when calendar is scrolled
- Applies to: drag-to-create, drag-to-move, and resize operations

### 21. Entry Popover Close Behavior (Added Dec 31, 2025)
**Decision**: Prevent re-opening on outside click
- **Issue**: Clicking outside popover to close it triggered `handleCreateStart` on calendar grid
- **Fix**: Pass `popoverOpen` state to `WeekView` component
- When `popoverOpen` is true, `handleCreateStart` returns early without action
- Allows clean close-then-new-interaction pattern

### 22. Drag-to-Create End Time (Added Dec 31, 2025)
**Decision**: Pre-fill both start and end time from drag operation
- `onCreateEvent` callback passes both `start` and `end` Date objects
- `EntryPopover` accepts new `defaultEndDate` prop
- Form pre-fills end date/time based on where mouse was released
- Falls back to +1 hour if `defaultEndDate` not provided

### 22. Calendar Entry Calendar Assignment (Added Dec 31, 2025)
**Decision**: Calendar selector in entry popover
- Dropdown appears only if calendars exist for the event
- Shows color indicator and name for each calendar
- "No calendar" option sets `calendar_id` to null
- Selected calendar saved with entry on create/update
- Pre-fills existing `calendar_id` when editing

### 24. Sidebar State Persistence (Added Dec 31, 2025, Updated Jan 1, 2026)
**Decision**: Sidebar collapsed by default with localStorage persistence
- Sidebar is collapsed by default on first visit
- State persisted to localStorage via Zustand persist middleware
- No page-specific compression - same behavior across all pages
- User's manual expand/collapse choice is remembered across sessions
- **History**:
  - Originally forced sidebar collapse on calendar pages only
  - Updated to allow user control on calendar pages
  - Final decision: Global default (collapsed) with user preference persistence
- **Implementation**: Uses `sidebarCollapsed` state in Zustand store with `partialize` to persist

### 25. Calendar Sidebar Sticky Positioning (Added Jan 1, 2026, Updated Jan 1, 2026)
**Decision**: Make mini-calendar sidebar fixed with proper height constraints
- Calendar sidebar uses `h-full` instead of `h-screen` to match parent container height
- Sidebar remains fixed while only the main calendar canvas area scrolls
- WeekView component has `overflow-auto` to enable scrolling for calendar grid
- Mini-calendar and calendars list always visible for quick navigation
- Ensures proper flex layout between sidebar and main content area
- **Updated Jan 1, 2026**: Event page uses `calc(100vh - 3rem)` for precise height calculation (3rem = 48px topbar)
  - Sidebar confined to viewport height minus topbar
  - Calendar canvas wrapped in ScrollArea component with `h-full` class for proper height
  - Week view: Day names header and all-day section moved inside ScrollArea to enable sticky positioning
  - Day names header sticks at `top-0`, all-day section sticks at `top-[57px]`
  - Only the time grid scrolls, headers remain sticky within the ScrollArea viewport
  - Both WeekView and MonthView use ScrollArea with explicit `h-full` height
  - Parent container uses `overflow-hidden` to constrain ScrollArea properly

### 25. Calendar Event Color Coding (Added Dec 31, 2025)
**Decision**: Events inherit colors from assigned calendars
- Calendar events display using their assigned calendar's color
- Events without calendar assignment use default primary color
- Colors applied to background, border, and text for visual consistency
- Color opacity: background 12%, border 25%, text full color

### 26. Calendar Visibility Filtering (Added Dec 31, 2025)
**Decision**: Hide events from hidden calendars
- When calendar visibility is toggled off, all its events are filtered from display
- Events without calendar assignment are always visible
- Filtering applied at component level before rendering calendar views

### 27. Calendar Deletion with Protection (Added Dec 31, 2025)
**Decision**: Allow calendar deletion with default calendar protection
- Users can delete calendars via trash icon in calendar sidebar
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletion
- Default/primary calendar cannot be deleted (UI shows disabled state)
- Deleting calendar sets all associated events' calendar_id to null

### 28. Default Primary Calendar System (Added Jan 1, 2026, Updated Jan 1, 2026)
**Decision**: Auto-create protected default calendar per event with database trigger
- "Primary" calendar automatically created when new event is created via database trigger
- Uses orange color (#f97316) and cannot be deleted
- Orange is reserved exclusively for Primary calendar and removed from user color choices
- Marked with `is_default: true` flag in database
- Shows special visual indicator (lock icon) in calendar list
- All new calendar entries default to this calendar (calendar selection required, no "No Calendar" option)
- **Database trigger**: `trigger_create_default_calendar` on events table ensures every event has a default calendar
- **Migration applied**: Created default calendars for all pre-existing events
- **Migration applied (Jan 1, 2026)**: Renamed "Main Calendar" to "Primary" and updated color to orange (#f97316)
- **Update (Jan 1, 2026)**: Removed "No Calendar" option from entry popover - all events must be assigned to a calendar

### 29. Entry Popover Close Behavior Fix (Added Dec 31, 2025)
**Decision**: Prevent dialog reopening on outside click
- Add debounce/delay mechanism when popover closes via outside click
- Track popover close timestamp to prevent immediate reopening
- Ensure click events on calendar grid don't trigger when popover just closed
- Apply 200ms delay before allowing new popover creation

### 30. All-Day Events Support (Added Jan 1, 2026)
**Decision**: Add all-day event checkbox and proper handling
- **Database**: Added `is_all_day` BOOLEAN column to `calendar_events` table (default: false)
- **UI**: All-day checkbox in entry popover dialog
  - Disables time inputs when checked
  - Sets start time to 00:00 and end time to 23:59 for all-day events
- **Time Grid**: Updated to show 24 hours (0-23) with final marker at 12 AM (midnight)
  - Time labels positioned below grid lines instead of above
  - Grid properly terminates at midnight (12 AM)
- **Color Coding**: All-day and multi-day events properly use calendar colors
  - Applied calendar color with opacity to all-day event bars
  - Falls back to primary color if no calendar assigned
- **Migration**: `20260101000004_add_is_all_day_to_calendar_events.sql`
- **Bugfix (Jan 1, 2026)**: Migration was not applied to production database
  - Issue: Calendar event creation was failing with database error
  - Root cause: `is_all_day` column existed in types but not in actual database
  - Fix: Applied migration `20260101000004_add_is_all_day_to_calendar_events.sql` to production
  - Verification: Confirmed column exists with correct type (BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false)

### 31. All-Day Section Sticky Positioning and Drag Support (Added Jan 1, 2026)
**Decision**: Make all-day section sticky and enable drag/drop for all-day events
- **Sticky positioning**: All-day section remains visible at `top-[57px]` (below day names header)
  - All-day label and event bars stay visible when scrolling time grid
  - Uses `z-20` to ensure proper layering above scrolling content
  - Background explicitly set to `bg-background` for proper visibility
- **Drag and drop for all-day events**: Multi-day and all-day events can now be dragged between days
  - Click and drag all-day events to move them to different days
  - Maintains event duration (number of days) when moved
  - Calculates day offset and adjusts both start and end dates accordingly
  - Visual feedback shows which day the event will move to
  - Hover state on all-day events indicates they're draggable
  - Opacity change when dragging to show source event

### 32. Week Start Configuration (Added Jan 1, 2026)
**Decision**: Change week start from Monday to Sunday
- All calendar views now start weeks on Sunday (weekStartsOn: 0)
- Applied to:
  - `getViewDateRange()` function
  - `getWeekDays()` function
  - `getMonthDays()` function
  - `formatDateHeader()` function
  - Month view week day headers array
- Matches common US calendar convention
- Consistent across week and month views

### 33. Calendar Sidebar Theme Consistency (Added Jan 1, 2026)
**Decision**: Match calendar sidebar background to main sidebar
- Calendar sidebar uses `bg-sidebar` class
- Mini calendar component uses `bg-sidebar` for consistency
- Ensures visual continuity between main app sidebar and calendar-specific sidebar
- Proper theme adherence using shadcn sidebar tokens

### 34. Multi-Day Event Creation via Drag-Select (Added Jan 1, 2026)
**Decision**: Enable drag-select in month view to create multi-day all-day events
- **Month view drag-select feature**:
  - Click and hold on empty space in month view
  - Drag across multiple days to select date range
  - Visual feedback: selected days highlighted with `bg-primary/10` and ring
  - Release mouse to open entry popover with all-day event pre-configured
  - Works independently from event dragging (event drag takes precedence)
- **Implementation details**:
  - State tracking: `isSelecting`, `selectionStart`, `selectionEnd`
  - Handlers: `handleSelectionStart()`, `handleSelectionMove()`, `isDaySelected()`
  - Selection range normalized (start always before end)
  - Times automatically set to 00:00 - 23:59 for all-day events
  - Opens entry popover centered in viewport
- **UX improvements**:
  - Prevents accidental selection when clicking events
  - Clear visual distinction between selection and hover states
  - Seamless integration with existing event creation flow

### 35. Automatic Event Calendar Entry Creation (Added Jan 1, 2026)
**Decision**: Auto-create matching calendar entry when event has dates
- When creating an event with `start_date` and/or `end_date`:
  - Automatically creates a calendar event on the Primary calendar
  - Calendar event spans from start_date (or end_date if no start) to end_date (or start_date if no end)
  - Event is marked as all-day (`is_all_day: true`)
  - Times set to 00:00 - 23:59 to span full day(s)
  - Title matches the event name
  - Description: "Event: [event name]"
- **Implementation**:
  - Logic added to `useCreateEvent()` mutation hook
  - Waits 100ms after event creation for database trigger to create Primary calendar
  - Queries for Primary calendar (`is_default: true`)
  - Creates calendar event with proper all-day configuration
  - Invalidates calendar-events query cache on success
- **Benefits**:
  - Provides immediate visual representation of event duration on calendar
  - Users see event dates reflected in calendar view automatically
  - Reduces manual entry creation for event organizers
  - Consistent with event-level metadata

### 36. Events Homepage Menu Item (Added Jan 1, 2026)
**Decision**: Add "Events" navigation link to sidebar footer
- New menu item labeled "Events" added to sidebar footer above Settings
- Links to events homepage at root path (`/`)
- Uses SquaresFour icon from Phosphor Icons
- Allows users to navigate back to events listing from any event workspace
- Positioned in footer section for easy access alongside Settings and Sign out
- Maintains consistent navigation pattern with other workspace tools

### 37. Sidebar Event Dates Display (Added Jan 1, 2026)
**Decision**: Show event dates instead of venue in sidebar header
- Event dropdown header displays formatted event dates as secondary text
- Uses same format as events homepage: "MMM d - MMM d, yyyy" or "Starts MMM d, yyyy"
- Fallback hierarchy: event dates → venue → "No dates set" → "No event selected"
- Provides more relevant contextual information at a glance
- Implemented using `formatEventDates()` utility function from date-fns
- Applies to both collapsed (icon tooltip) and expanded sidebar states

## File Management Rules

**CRITICAL**: The AI agent is ONLY allowed to touch AGENTS.md for documentation purposes.

**Prohibited**:
- Creating additional doc files
- Creating README files
- Creating ARCHITECTURE.md or similar
- Creating any markdown documentation besides AGENTS.md

All decisions, notes, and documentation must be consolidated in this single file.

## Tech Stack Constraints

**Framework**: Next.js (App Router only)
**UI**: shadcn/ui (must be fully theme adherent)
**Backend**: Supabase (Auth + Postgres)
**State**: Zustand (global) + React Query (server)
**Calendar Library**: date-fns (date logic only, custom UI)

## Layout Component References

- **Home page**: Simple header with card grid (no sidebar)
- **Main sidebar**: shadcn block "sidebar-9" (collapsible nested) - only in event workspace
- **Calendar internal sidebar**: shadcn block "sidebar-12" (adapted for calendar)
- **Settings dialog**: shadcn block "sidebar-13" (in dialog, not page)

## Data Storage Principles

- UTC for all timestamps
- Minimal schema (only fields needed for MVP)
- Use Supabase RLS for security
- Direct mapping from Supabase Auth to organizers table

## Database Schema Updates

### events table (Updated Dec 31, 2025)
Added columns:
- `start_date` (DATE, nullable) - Event start date
- `end_date` (DATE, nullable) - Event end date  
- `icon` (TEXT, default '📅') - Emoji icon for the event

Constraint: `check_end_date_after_start_date` - ensures end_date >= start_date when both are set

### calendars table (Added Jan 1, 2025, Updated Jan 1, 2026)
New table for organizing calendar events into categories:
- `id` (UUID, primary key)
- `event_id` (UUID, foreign key to events)
- `name` (TEXT, not null) - Calendar name (e.g., "Workshops", "Talks")
- `color` (TEXT, default '#f97316') - Hex color code (updated to orange for Primary calendar)
- `is_visible` (BOOLEAN, default true) - Toggle visibility
- `is_default` (BOOLEAN, default false) - Marks the default calendar (cannot be deleted)
- `created_at`, `updated_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ)

RLS policies mirror events table (organizer-based access).

**Database triggers**:
- `trigger_create_default_calendar`: Automatically creates "Primary" calendar when event is inserted
- Ensures every event always has at least one default calendar
- Function: `create_default_calendar_for_event()` (updated Jan 1, 2026 to use "Primary" name and orange color)

### calendar_events table (Updated Jan 1, 2025, Updated Jan 1, 2026)
Added column:
- `calendar_id` (UUID, nullable, foreign key to calendars)

Allows assigning calendar entries to specific calendars for color-coding.

**Updated Jan 1, 2026**:
- `is_all_day` (BOOLEAN, default false) - Indicates if event spans full day(s) without specific time slots

## Component Implementation Details

### Create Event Dialog (Updated Dec 31, 2025)

### 38. Workspace Navigation Menu (Added Jan 1, 2026)
**Decision**: Add core workspace navigation items to main sidebar
- **Menu items in 'Workspace' group**:
  - **Dashboard** (House icon) → `/events/{eventId}/dashboard`
  - **Tasks** (CheckCircle icon) → `/events/{eventId}/tasks`
  - **Team** (UsersThree icon) → `/events/{eventId}/team`

  - Column management hooks removed (no longer needed)
- **Tasks page** at `/events/{eventId}/tasks`:
  - Full-page kanban board layout
  - Empty state shows loading message
  - All operations happen within kanban board
  - No separate task detail views in MVP

### 40. Database Triggers for Tasks (Added Jan 1, 2026)
**Decision**: Automatic default column creation
- **Trigger function**: `create_default_task_columns_for_event()`
  - Fires AFTER INSERT on events table
  - Creates 3 default columns: "Not Started" (0), "In Progress" (1), "Done" (2)
  - Ensures every event always has task management capability
- **Migration**: Applied to existing events during migration
  - Backfilled default columns for all pre-existing events
  - Handles cases where columns already exist (no duplicates)

### 41. Event Layout and CurrentEventId Management (Added Jan 1, 2026)
**Decision**: Shared layout for all event pages to manage currentEventId
- **Issue**: Sidebar workspace menu items (Dashboard, Tasks, Team, Calendar) were grayed out on event pages
- **Root cause**: Only calendar page set `currentEventId` in Zustand store; other event pages didn't
- **Fix**: Created shared layout at `/src/app/(app)/events/[eventId]/layout.tsx`
  - Layout extracts `eventId` from URL params using `useParams()`
  - Sets `currentEventId` in Zustand store via `useEffect` on mount
  - All child pages (calendar, dashboard, tasks, team) inherit this behavior
  - Removed duplicate `setCurrentEventId` logic from calendar page
- **Benefit**: Single source of truth for event context, consistent sidebar state across all workspace pages

### 42. AppShell Header Responsive Width (Added Jan 1, 2026)
**Decision**: Header dynamically adjusts left position based on sidebar state
- **Issue**: Fixed header didn't resize when sidebar collapsed/expanded
- **Root cause**: Header used static `var(--sidebar-width)` for left position
- **Fix**: Created `AppHeader` component inside `AppShell` that:
  - Uses `useSidebar()` hook to get current sidebar state
  - Dynamically sets `left` style based on collapsed state:
    - Collapsed: `var(--sidebar-width-icon)` (3rem)
    - Expanded: `var(--sidebar-width)` (16rem)
  - Maintains smooth transition animation via `transition-[left]` class
- **Implementation**: Header is now a separate component inside SidebarProvider to access sidebar context




### 43. Teams and Members System (Added Jan 1, 2026)
**Decision**: Add collaboration layer with teams and invites
- **Event-level roles**: Owner, Admin, Member
  - Owner: Event creator, full control, cannot transfer ownership, cannot leave
  - Admin: Manage members/teams/invites, can leave voluntarily
  - Member: View only assigned teams, can leave voluntarily, cannot leave teams unless removed by Owner/Admin
- **Teams structure**:
  - Teams are organizational only (no permissions)
  - Used for grouping and filtering members
  - Members can belong to multiple teams
  - Unlimited team size
  - Unassigned members allowed
- **Permission rules**:
  - Owner and Admins can create/edit/delete teams
  - Owner and Admins can assign members to teams
  - Members see only their assigned teams
  - Owner and Admins see all teams
- **UI Layout**: Two-column layout on Team page
  - Left: Team list (320px fixed width)
  - Right: Selected team details (flexible)
  - Modal-based member assignment (no drag-drop)

### 44. Invite System Design (Added Jan 1, 2026)
**Decision**: Dual invite mechanism with email and shareable links
- **Email invites**:
  - Admins/Owners enter email address
  - Supabase Auth `inviteUserByEmail()` sends magic link
  - Invite scoped to single event
  - Always adds as "Member" role
  - 48-hour expiry
- **Link invites**:
  - Admins/Owners generate shareable links
  - Each link has UUID token and 48-hour expiry
  - Multiple active links allowed per event
  - Anyone with link can join as "Member"
  - Tokens stored in `event_invites` table
- **Token security**:
  - UUID v4 for tokens (not short codes)
  - Server-side expiry validation
  - Tokens marked as used on acceptance
  - No token reuse after expiry
- **Email provider**: Supabase default SMTP (no custom provider)

### 45. Event Deletion and Ownership Rules (Added Jan 1, 2026)
**Decision**: Hard delete with specific cleanup rules
- **Event deletion**: Hard delete (no soft delete or retention)
  - Cascades to all event_members, event_teams, team_members
  - Calendar events and tasks also deleted via existing foreign keys
- **Team deletion**: Members remain in event, removed from team only
  - Calendar events assigned to team move to Primary calendar
  - Tasks assigned to team move to Primary calendar (if team-scoped tasks added later)
- **Ownership transfer**: Not supported in MVP
  - Owner role fixed for event lifetime
  - Owner cannot be removed or leave event
- **Member removal**: 
  - Members can leave event voluntarily (removes from all teams)
  - Admins can leave event voluntarily
  - Admins/Owner can remove other members
  - Members cannot leave teams unless Owner/Admin removes them

### 46. Team Visibility and Access Control (Added Jan 1, 2026)
**Decision**: Role-based team visibility with RLS enforcement
- **Visibility rules**:
  - Members see only teams they are assigned to
  - Owner and Admins see all teams in event
  - Team list filtered at application layer (React Query)
  - RLS policies enforce event-level access
- **Member list visibility**: All event members can see full member list
  - Required for displaying team members
  - Role badges shown on member cards
  - Owner indicated with special badge/icon
- **Data consistency**: Last-write-wins for concurrent edits
  - No optimistic locking or conflict resolution
  - Acceptable for MVP scale (small teams, infrequent conflicts)
  - React Query cache invalidation on mutations

### 47. Teams Database Schema (Added Jan 1, 2026)
**Decision**: Three new tables with RLS policies
- **`event_members` table**: Event membership with roles
  - Columns: id, event_id, user_id, role, joined_at, created_at, updated_at
  - Unique constraint on (event_id, user_id)
  - RLS: Members can view, Owner/Admin can insert/update/delete
  - Trigger: Auto-create Owner member on event creation
- **`event_teams` table**: Teams within events
  - Columns: id, event_id, name, description, created_at, updated_at
  - Name max 100 chars, description max 500 chars
  - RLS: Members can view, Owner/Admin can create/update/delete
- **`team_members` table**: Junction table for member-to-team assignments
  - Columns: id, team_id, member_id, assigned_at
  - Unique constraint on (team_id, member_id)
  - Cascading deletes on team or member deletion
  - RLS: Members can view, Owner/Admin can insert/delete
- **`event_invites` table**: Invite metadata for email and link invites
  - Columns: id, event_id, invite_type, token, email, invited_by, expires_at, used_at, created_at
  - Unique index on token (UUID v4)
  - Constraint: email required for email invites
  - RLS: Public can view valid invites, Owner/Admin can create/update/delete
  - No automatic cleanup (manual or scheduled for production)

### 48. Team Page Navigation (Added Jan 1, 2026)
**Decision**: Add Team menu item to workspace navigation
- **Route**: `/events/[eventId]/team`
- **Sidebar position**: Between Tasks and Calendar in Workspace group
- **Icon**: UsersThree from Phosphor Icons
- **Behavior**: Same as other workspace items (disabled when no event selected)
- **Layout**: Inherits AppShell (header + sidebar), full-width content area
- **Active state**: Uses pathname matching like other workspace pages

### 49. Invite Page Route (Added Jan 1, 2026)
**Decision**: Standalone public invite acceptance page
- **Route**: `/invite/[token]`
- **Layout**: Centered card, no sidebar (public page)
- **States**:
  - Valid token: Show event name/icon, "Accept Invite" button → Supabase Auth
  - Expired/invalid: Error message, "Go to Events" button
  - Already member: Info message, "Go to Event" button
- **Auth flow**: After Supabase authentication, add to event_members and redirect to event
- **Token validation**: Server-side check for expiry, usage, and event existence

### 50. shadcn Theme Adherence for Teams (Added Jan 1, 2026)
**Decision**: Follow pre-installed shadcn theme
- Use existing theme configuration (no custom theme selection)
- All Team page components use shadcn primitives:
  - Dialog for modals (create/edit team, assign members)
  - AlertDialog for confirmations (delete team, remove member)
  - Input, Textarea for forms
  - Checkbox for multi-select
  - Badge for role/count indicators
  - Avatar for member display
  - Tabs for invite dialog (email vs link)
  - Card for team items
- **Color tokens**: Use CSS variables (--primary, --secondary, --destructive, etc.)
- **No custom colors**: All UI uses theme-defined colors
- **Consistent spacing**: Follow shadcn spacing scale (p-4, gap-2, etc.)
